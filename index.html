                    <h3>About Me</h3>
                    <div class="half-width">
                        <p>Hello! My name is Annie Heath. I'm 32 years old and I was born in the U.S. I'm originally from Florida
                          but I've lived in Philadelphia, Los Angeles, and for two years I lived on a tour bus that went around
                          the U.S. with a Shakespeare company. I have a theater degree from Florida State University. For about
                          ten years I worked in film, tv, and theater, making props and doing set dressing. Three years ago I
                          decided the theatre life was not for me and I moved to Japan to teach English. Japan was amazing! I really
                          enjoyed learning about the culture, meeting the people, and especially eating the food. In 2020 I moved to
                          Madrid, Spain to work in a bilingual secondary school.</p>
                          <br>
                          <p>I have tons of hobbies. I like learning languages,
                          arts and crafts, cooking, baking, tending to my indoor garden, traveling, listening to podcasts, and
                          playing video games.</p>
